# Habtech2-RO-Configs
KSP realism Overhaul Configuration files for Habtech2 parts to build real scale ISS.
Requires latest release of ROTanks, ROLib, TacLifeSupport, module manager and any other RO hard dependancies.
Tested in KSP 1.11.1
place anywhere in GameData folder and remove existing Habtech2 configs from RO suggested mods folder.

All parts are currently marked as WIP!

You also may experience a few parts not scaling to full size. This is due to a few original parts having 2 'rescaleFactor' instructions within their configurations. To correct this, go into the config of the affected part and delete the first 'rescaleFactor' line. Be sure to save the config alteration. The affected parts will now scale as intended by the RO config.
